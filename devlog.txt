Things we shall do to make things awesome:

1) Use the simplest code we know of to perform each of our task. This will 
prevent unnecessary confusion, and help our eyes.

2) Instead of falling for the temptation to just produce code that barely 
works in that situation, we will make sure to test our code thoroughly. Unlike
the internet which is barely held together, we will make sure our code will be 
robust. 

3) We will continue to use and write "Good Code" except ours include team 
collaboration. This will be done by intensively scrutinizing each of our 
functions to make sure everything could be understood by orangutans.

- Completely re-drew the database schema for clearer representation.
- Added a third table since task was slightly misunderstood at first. Blogs
now have descriptions and ids in respect to the order of creation. 
- Third table is "Post" and has same columns as "Blog" table with addition of
post_id to keep track of order of posts and blog_id is used to correctly
tie posts to their respected blogs.
- Timestamp column is added to display the time and date of post creation
near the post title.
- Added explanations for each table and of their usage.

-fixed wording on what we meant when referencing tables
-changed search to search/view to better reflect what the component does
-removed the bit about sqlite databases, because it doesn't belong in components
-explained the displaying posts part 
-removed line referencing the need to be logged in because its redundant

Something else we can do to write good code is to communicate and set clear deadlines. The project manager will coordinate and make sure that deadlines for each obstacle is established so we aren’t rushing to add all the components together at the very last minute. Multiple deadlines for smaller tasks is key to make sure the final version is comprehensive and on time.
