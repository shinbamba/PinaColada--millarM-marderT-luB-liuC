Things we shall do to make things awesome:
1) Use the simplest code we know of to perform each of our task. This will
prevent unnecessary confusion, and help our eyes.
2) Instead of falling for the temptation to just produce code that barely
works in that situation, we will make sure to test our code thoroughly. Unlike
the internet which is barely held together, we will make sure our code will be
robust.
3) We will continue to use and write "Good Code" except ours include team
collaboration. This will be done by intensively scrutinizing each of our
functions to make sure everything could be understood by orangutans.

- Completely re-drew the database schema for clearer representation.
- Added a third table since task was slightly misunderstood at first. Blogs
now have descriptions and ids in respect to the order of creation.
- Third table is "Post" and has same columns as "Blog" table with addition of
post_id to keep track of order of posts and blog_id is used to correctly
tie posts to their respected blogs.
- Timestamp column is added to display the time and date of post creation
near the post title.
- Added explanations for each table and of their usage.

--------------------------------------------------------------

-fixed wording on what we meant when referencing tables
-changed search to search/view to better reflect what the component does
-removed the bit about sqlite databases, because it doesn't belong in components
-explained the displaying posts part
-removed line referencing the need to be logged in because its redundant

--------------------------------------------------------------

Something else we can do to write good code is to communicate and set clear
deadlines. The project manager will coordinate and make sure that deadlines for
each obstacle is established so we aren’t rushing to add all the components together
at the very last minute. Multiple deadlines for smaller tasks is key to make sure the
final version is comprehensive and on time.

-wrote resetdb.py to create/reset the database file blogger.db, with login table instantiated with test logins
-began writing main file blog.py, added login and user registration mechanisms with sql integration
-wrote login.html and register.html, for displaying /login and /register routes with text input
-added / route with a simple line to show that user is logged in

claireL -- 2018-10-19 12:04
-Added post and blog table to the database
-Added time stamp after we saw another group do it (we thought it was cool)

-------------------------------------------------------------

timM --2018-10-20 19:34
- Created the login table in the database.
- Added column for usernames and passwords.
- Made python use the database data in order to check for username and password
of users when logging in. Completed authentication step.

-------------------------------------------------------------

timM --2018-10-21 21:29
- Forgot to add logout feature last time so worked on that this time.
- Made sessions work in Flask. (Website now remembers the user if he/she leaves the website
and comes back without logging out.)
- Created the /templates folder and created the necessary .html files for the pages.
- Connected pages to python using flask.
- Started working on HTML and Jinja Syntax in all necessary pages.
- Finished basic functionality in the HTML pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------

boL -- 2018-10-21 (over the course of the day)

-Completed version one of the authentication system using similar code from the previous
assignment. Used hardcoded user and password at first.
-Encountered an issue with using sessions. Realized it was a dumb mistake where I had a typo.
-Successfully added user account creation using Tim’s database.
-Encountered another issue where the user seemed to be able to log in with any combination
of password and username, regardless of if it's registered or not. After some debugging, I
found that -I mistakenly make the login system add to the database during the checking of
whether it's an account.
-Finished up version one, with a working authentication and account creation.
-Added error messages to help the user out.
-Occasionally encountered error where though a login attempt with incorrect an account will
fail the Login, the URL changes to displaying the incorrect combo instead of an error message.
(unresolved, because it happens very rarely)
-Have an almost solid Version Two, excluding the rare error mentioned above.

-------------------------------------------------------------

claireL -- 2018-10-21 (over the course of the day)
-On Sunday, we all met up to finish the basic functionality of the project and pushed it all on Max's account.
-Search/edit functionality works now
-Some problems include: incorrect flash messages such as flashing "Error, user does not exist" even when the user does exist
-HTML issues where the code is not organized and there are discrepancies between what is clickable and what isn't. Also the blogs just look really ugly right now.
-In class, we updated the readme with full instructions. We also realized there was a database problem where when we run the code there's a sqlite error involving logins and trying to register a new account. This was fixed when we ran the resetdb.py file.
-Tim will work on fixing up the HTML tonight.

-------------------------------------------------------------

boL -- 2018-10-22
-Updated read.me to include the directions for necessary commands to run our code

-------------------------------------------------------------

maxM -- 2018-10-22
-Updated the main code with what we worked on over the weekend

-------------------------------------------------------------

claireL -- 2018-10-23 12:20
-Fixed up the read.me with proper formatting.
-Learned that paragraph breaks require two spaces instead of just one and pressing enter.
-Also learned a bunch of cool syntax rules for editing the readme [Thanks Zane for posting that in the QAF]

-------------------------------------------------------------

boL -- 2018-10-24 11:50
-Added more to read.me to comply with what Mr. Brown mentioned in class.
-Learned about ability to use dictionaries in jinja(from Kevin Lin's post)
-Helped fix a little html for clarity

-------------------------------------------------------------

timM -- 2018-10-24 11:50
- Played around with the database executed commands in python to find the most
robust way to get data from database/put data into database.
- Helped Max fix a bug with flashing in flask. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

claireL -- 2018-10-24 11:51
- Fixed html by adding navigation and easier viewing of said navigation 
- Changed post to entry for clarity's sake

-pushed design doc (updated version)
-fixed the readme so that the code blocks looked clearer
